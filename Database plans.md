<h1> Initial Database design</h1>
<h2> Overview</h2> <br>
<p> This is the first look at my plans for the data base that will store one part of the data. <br>
The data that I am going to scrape originates from "HM Land Registry Open Data". I am going to store the information of when a property was last sold and the identifiers of that property.</p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3>Thought Process</h3>
  
<p>I thought the best Normal Form for storing this kind of Data is a 3NF. 
By using a 3NF database design I aim to reduce redundant data from tables.<br> 
The reasons being: Memory effectiveness, Improving data integrity, simplifying queries in the future. </p>
