# Web-scrapping-API

<h2> Overview- </h2> <br>
<p>.This is going to be the skeletons of my web Scrapping API that I intend to use for learning and potentially future business ventures.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h3> Description-</h3> <br>
<p>.In this project I will be attempting to create an API from Scratch and connect it to a postgreSQL Database.
.I aim to also utilise Python in order to visualise and manipulate the data that will be fetched from the API.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h4>Goals and learning outcomes-</h4> <br>
.My goal is to create a working API that will return me the nescessary data for me to analyse and build reports on that could be comercially sold.
.I inted to use this project as a learning opportuinity to expand my skill set as a developer, data analyst and data engineer.
.I also want to use this as part of a portfolio for my career in Data Engineer.
